BloomSync is a automatic directory (content) syncronizer written in Python. The command-line tool provides an interface to synchronize the contents of two directories in periodic amounts of time. 

# Installation

Run `install.sh`. This will create a new (hidden) folder at your home directory and place `dirs.json` for the directories and a `sync.log` file that acts as a log everytime synchronization takes place.
